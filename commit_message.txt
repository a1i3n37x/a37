feat: Integrate SmbTool, HydraTool, HttpPageFetcherTool as LLM functions

Adds direct AI callable functions for SMB enumeration (smb_enumerate),
password brute-forcing (hydra_bruteforce), and web page content
fetching (fetch_web_page_content) to llm_functions.py.

- Implemented new functions with parameter handling, caching, and
  error responses leveraging existing tool wrappers.
- Updated LLM_TOOL_FUNCTIONS registry with schemas for the new tools.
- Enhanced AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT in core/agent.py to make the AI
  aware of these new capabilities and provide guidance for their use
  in CTF scenarios.

This significantly expands the AI assistant's ability to propose and
execute a wider range of reconnaissance tasks.
