---

**Phase 4: Boot Sequence: Zero-to-First-Blood (2 weeks)**
*Goal: A total newcomer downloads Alien Recon and can realistically achieve an initial foothold (e.g., find a flag) on a beginner CTF box within a short timeframe, supported by helpful outputs and a clear sense of accomplishment.*

*   âœ… **`a37 init --ctf <box_identifier>` (COMPLETED January 2025):**
    *   âœ… **YAML metadata format** for CTF boxes with comprehensive fields (box_name, platform, expected_key_services, VPN instructions, learning objectives, hints).
    *   âœ… **Local metadata system** with sample CTF boxes (TryHackMe Basic Pentesting, Hack The Box Lame, test development box).
    *   âœ… **Mission folder creation** (`./a37_missions/<box_identifier>/`) with automatic organization.
    *   âœ… **Notes template system** with comprehensive CTF reconnaissance template automatically copied to mission folders.
    *   âœ… **Session CTF context** integration - AI assistant is aware of active CTF mission and can provide targeted guidance.
    *   âœ… **Dynamic IP handling** - correctly handles CTF platforms where IPs are assigned after box start.
    *   âœ… **Rich console output** with VPN setup guidance, expected services display, and mission status.
    *   âœ… **Comprehensive error handling** and user-friendly messaging for invalid box identifiers.
*   âœ… **`quick-recon` macro/command (COMPLETED January 2025):**
    *   âœ… A wrapper command that helps users quickly run a sequence of recon tools with opinionated default settings, but always with user confirmation and control.
    *   âœ… Implements `a37 quick-recon --target <target_ip>` with predefined sequence: initial SYN scan, service detection on discovered ports, and web enumeration/vulnerability scanning on HTTP/HTTPS services.
    *   âœ… Maintains educational value through existing `_confirm_tool_proposal` flow with parameter explanations.
*   [ ] **Exploit Suggestion (formerly Auto-Exploit Stub):**
    *   [ ] Based on service versions identified (Nmap, Nikto) and potential vulnerabilities (Nikto):
        *   Integrate `searchsploit` or a similar local exploit database lookup.
        *   The AI will present potential exploits or vulnerability categories found, explaining them.
        *   **Crucially, guide the user on how to *manually* research and attempt these using Metasploit or other tools, rather than auto-firing.** This maintains focus on learning. (e.g., "Nmap identified vsftpd 2.3.4. This version is known to be vulnerable (CVE-XXXX-XXXX). You could try searching for modules in Metasploit using `search vsftpd 2.3.4` and then learn to configure and run the `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor` module.")
*   [ ] **`debrief` generator:**
    *   [ ] After a session, allow the user to generate a templated Markdown report.
    *   [ ] The report should summarize:
        *   Target information.
        *   Key Nmap findings.
        *   Significant results from ffuf, Nikto, enum4linux-ng.
        *   (Future, from Phase 4.5) MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed/suggested.
        *   Any exploit suggestions made.
        *   A section for the user to add their own notes and flag.
*   [ ] **Flag Capture Feedback & Motivation:**
    *   [ ] Implement a simple command like `a37 flag <flag_string>` or allow the user to tell the AI "I found the flag! It's XYZ".
    *   [ ] Display a fun ASCII art confirmation / "dopamine hit" message.

**Status: Phase 4 - IN PROGRESS (Feature 2/4 Complete)** ðŸš€

---

**Phase 4.5: Enhanced Learning & Context - MITRE ATT&CK Integration (1-2 weeks, can overlap with Phase 4)**
*Goal: Deepen the educational value by linking reconnaissance actions and findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, helping users understand the broader context of their techniques.*

*   [ ] **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping in Tool Wrappers/Parsers:**
    *   [ ] Research and identify relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with the information gathered by Nmap, ffuf, Nikto, and enum4linux-ng.
    *   [ ] Modify the `parse_output` methods in tool classes (or add a subsequent analysis step) to include a list of relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs in their structured results.
*   [ ] **AI Explanation of MITRE Techniques:**
    *   [ ] Update the `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to instruct the AI to:
        *   Recognize MITRE technique IDs in tool results.
        *   Briefly explain the identified technique(s) to the user in simple terms when discussing tool findings.
        *   (Optional) Provide a link to the MITRE ATT&CK website for that technique.
*   [ ] **`debrief` Generator Update:**
    *   [ ] Include a section in the Markdown report listing the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified/used during the session.
*   [ ] **(Stretch Goal for 4.5) Simple `--show-mitre-matrix` for Session:**
    *   [ ] At the end of a session, provide an option to display a very simple, text-based summary of tactics covered (e.g., Reconnaissance: [T1046, T1083], Discovery: [T1087]). Not a full visual matrix yet, but a list.

**Status: Phase 4.5 - To Be Started**

---

**Post v1.0 (After Nailing Phase 4.5 & Gathering Feedback):**

*   **User Feedback Analysis:** Collect and analyze user feedback on the v1.0 experience. What do they love? What's missing? What's confusing?
*   **Next Steps Prioritization:** Based on feedback and your vision, then decide on features from the original "Phase 5+" (e.g., more advanced progressive disclosure, hint systems, specific skill modules, plugin architecture if heavily requested) or entirely new ideas.
*   **Focus on iterative improvements** to the core experience.

**AI Assistant Reference & Project Vision**

**What is Alien Recon (a37)?**
- An AI-guided, modular recon framework for CTFs, red team drills, and OSINT.
- Designed for beginners and pros: automates tedious recon, but also teaches and explains.
- CLI-driven, with AI chat guidance and structured, actionable output.

**Current Capabilities:**
- Robust wrappers for nmap, ffuf, nikto, enum4linux-ng, hydra, and http-fetcher.
- All tools have real parsing logic and are fully tested (including edge/error cases).
- Consistent output schema (`ToolResult`) for all tools.
- Interactive and scriptable CLI (Typer-based).
- System health/doctor checks.

**Your Vision & Goals:**
- Make CTF recon accessible, fast, and educational.
- Blend automation with AI mentorship: teach users the "why" and "how" of recon, not just the "what".
- Enable both guided (novice) and power-user (expert) workflows, but always with user control.
- Build a foundation for extensibility: new tools, new task types, new learning modules.

**What You're Working Towards:**
- Phase 3: Modular, user-driven recon with robust, flexible tool execution and results management.
- Phase 4: "Zero-to-First-Blood"â€”a newcomer can get a flag with AI help, and generate a debrief report.
- Phase 4.5: MITRE ATT&CK tagging and educational context.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
- **Move into Phase 3 now:** Your core is strong and tested. Focus on making each tool easy to use, robust, and flexible for user-driven workflows. Validate your architecture and make it easy to add new tools later.
- **Design for extensibility:** Make each tool wrapper generic and pluggable. Each new tool should be easy to add/test.
- **After Phase 3, add more tools:** ffuf, wpscan, amass, searchsploit, etc. can be added as new modules.
- **Focus on user experience:** Keep the AI guidance clear, actionable, and educational. Make the CLI and reports beautiful and motivating.
- **Gather feedback early:** Once the new workflow is working, get user feedback to guide Phase 4/4.5 priorities.

**Things You Could Add (Future):**
- More tool integrations (ffuf, wpscan, amass, nuclei, etc.)
- Plugin/module registration system for community-contributed modules
- More advanced reporting (Markdown, HTML, PDF)
- Interactive learning/hint modules
- Pro mode with advanced chaining, custom task graphs
- Cloud/remote target support
- Web UI or TUI (text UI) for richer experience

**If you're an AI or developer jumping in:**
- Read the README and this section for project philosophy and priorities.
- Review the CLI, SessionController, and tool wrappers for architecture.
- All new tools should follow the `ToolResult` schema and have robust tests/fixtures.
- Focus on making recon both powerful and educationalâ€”automation is great, but teaching is the differentiator.

This section is your quick-start for understanding the project, its direction, and how to contribute or extend it successfully.

## Roadmap Update: Focus on Assistant-Driven Workflow

- The primary goal is to provide a conversational, AI-guided recon experience.
- Users should interact with the assistant, which will:
  - Run tools on request
  - Explain results
  - Suggest next steps
  - Manage session context and history
- Direct tool subcommands are optional for advanced/manual use and do not provide AI/assistant features.

### Key Tasks
- Improve assistant's ability to:
  - Orchestrate tool runs based on user input
  - Parse and explain tool results
  - Suggest next steps and automate workflows
  - Manage session state and history
- Update documentation and CLI help to reflect this focus
