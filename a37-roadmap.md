**Alien Recon (a37) - Focused Roadmap to v1.0 (Updated June 2025)**

**Overall Goal:** Build an AI-guided ethical hacking assistant focused on CTF reconnaissance for beginners, culminating in a "Zero-to-First-Blood" experience with integrated learning aids like MITRE ATT&CK tagging.

---

**Phase 0: Kick-off & Repo Hygiene (Â½ week)**
*Goal: Set up src-layout package, CI, linting, pyproject, etc.*
*   âœ… **Project Initialization:** Poetry project (`a37`) with `src` layout (`src/alienrecon`).
*   âœ… **`pyproject.toml` Configuration:** (Metadata, Python version, dependencies, scripts, tool configs).
*   âœ… **Linter/Formatter Setup:** (`ruff`, `pre-commit`).
*   âœ… **Basic CI Setup (GitHub Actions):** (Checkout, Python setup, Poetry install, caching, pre-commit runs).
*   âœ… **Directory Structure & File Migration:** (Organized `src/alienrecon` structure).
*   âœ… **`.gitignore`** configured.

**Status: Phase 0 - COMPLETE** ðŸŽ‰

---

**Phase 1: Core Refactor + Typer CLI (1 week)**
*Goal: Typer-based alienrecon CLI with sub-commands. SessionController class. Preserve current Nmapâ†’Gobusterâ†’Niktoâ†’enum4linux-ng path. Done = alienrecon recon <target> works; CI green.*

*   âœ… **Typer-based `alienrecon` CLI:** (`src/alienrecon/cli.py`, sub-commands, options).
*   âœ… **`SessionController` class (`src/alienrecon/core/session.py`):** (Initialization, tool management, interactive loop logic, LLM interaction, tool execution & confirmation).
*   âœ… **Preserve current Nmapâ†’Gobusterâ†’Niktoâ†’enum4linux-ng path:** (AI-guided flow implemented).
*   âœ… **Done = `alienrecon recon <target>` works; CI green.**

**Status: Phase 1 - COMPLETE** ðŸŽ‰

**Phase 2: Reliability & Testing (1 week)**
*Goal: Parser unit-tests, standard result schema, rich logging, doctor command. Ensure a robust and trustworthy core.*

*   âœ… **Parser unit-tests + fixtures (> 80 % coverage):**
    *   âœ… All core tools have sample raw outputs and robust tests (success, failure, edge cases).
*   âœ… **Standard Result Schema:**
    *   âœ… Consistent `ToolResult` structure (TypedDict) for all tool outputs.
*   âœ… **Rich Logging & User-Controlled Verbosity:**
    *   âœ… Logging and error handling are robust and user-friendly.
*   âœ… **`alienrecon doctor` self-test command:**

**Phase 3: TaskQueue & Auto-Recon Loop (1 week)**
*Goal: Enable chained scans without constant prompts via TaskQueue and `recon --auto`, providing a faster path through initial recon stages.*

*   [ ] **`TaskDetail` & `TaskQueue` Implementation:**
    *   [ ] Define `TaskDetail` (e.g., Pydantic model) to encapsulate tool name, target, arguments, port, wordlist, and a `post_hook` callback.
    *   [ ] Create a `TaskQueue` class to manage a list of `TaskDetail` objects, with methods for adding tasks and processing them.
*   [ ] **Auto Mode (`recon --auto`):**
    *   [ ] In `SessionController.start_auto_recon()`:
        *   Enqueue an initial Nmap scan task.
        *   The Nmap task's `post_hook` will analyze Nmap results and dynamically enqueue appropriate follow-up tasks (Gobuster/Nikto for web ports, enum4linux-ng for SMB). This logic will be rule-based for initial implementation (not LLM-driven for task generation within auto-mode to ensure speed and cost-effectiveness).
        *   The `TaskQueue` processes tasks sequentially.
        *   LLM can be used at the *end* of the auto-recon sequence for a comprehensive summary of all findings.
*   [ ] **Confirmation Matrix for Auto Mode:**
    *   If `is_novice_mode` is true, `TaskQueue.process_next_task()` uses `_confirm_tool_proposal` before executing each task.
    *   If `is_novice_mode` is false (expert), `TaskQueue` presents a summary of all planned scans from the current batch for a single confirmation, or runs them directly (user preference to be determined, perhaps via a config or sub-flag like `--auto-confirm-expert`).

**Status: Phase 3 - NEXT UP**

---

**Phase 4: Boot Sequence: Zero-to-First-Blood (2 weeks)**
*Goal: A total newcomer downloads Alien Recon and can realistically achieve an initial foothold (e.g., find a flag) on a beginner CTF box within a short timeframe, supported by helpful outputs and a clear sense of accomplishment.*

*   [ ] **`a37 init --ctf <box_identifier>`:**
    *   [ ] Define a simple metadata format (e.g., YAML/JSON) for beginner CTF boxes (e.g., target IP, VPN info, key services to expect).
    *   [ ] Implement logic to fetch/load this metadata (initially could be local files, later a small shared repo).
    *   [ ] Create a mission folder for the user, potentially pre-populating VPN config files or notes.
*   [ ] **`quick-recon` macro/command:**
    *   [ ] A wrapper command that essentially runs `recon --target <ip_from_init> --auto [--novice/--expert based on preference]` with opinionated default settings suitable for quick initial assessment of common CTF boxes.
*   [ ] **Exploit Suggestion (formerly Auto-Exploit Stub):**
    *   [ ] Based on service versions identified (Nmap, Nikto) and potential vulnerabilities (Nikto):
        *   Integrate `searchsploit` or a similar local exploit database lookup.
        *   The AI will present potential exploits or vulnerability categories found, explaining them.
        *   **Crucially, guide the user on how to *manually* research and attempt these using Metasploit or other tools, rather than auto-firing.** This maintains focus on learning. (e.g., "Nmap identified vsftpd 2.3.4. This version is known to be vulnerable (CVE-XXXX-XXXX). You could try searching for modules in Metasploit using `search vsftpd 2.3.4` and then learn to configure and run the `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor` module.")
*   [ ] **`debrief` generator:**
    *   [ ] After a session (interactive or auto), allow the user to generate a templated Markdown report.
    *   [ ] The report should summarize:
        *   Target information.
        *   Key Nmap findings.
        *   Significant results from Gobuster, Nikto, enum4linux-ng.
        *   (Future, from Phase 4.5) MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed/suggested.
        *   Any exploit suggestions made.
        *   A section for the user to add their own notes and flag.
*   [ ] **Flag Capture Feedback & Motivation:**
    *   [ ] Implement a simple command like `a37 flag <flag_string>` or allow the user to tell the AI "I found the flag! It's XYZ".
    *   [ ] Display a fun ASCII art confirmation / "dopamine hit" message.

**Status: Phase 4 - To Be Started**

---

**Phase 4.5: Enhanced Learning & Context - MITRE ATT&CK Integration (1-2 weeks, can overlap with Phase 4)**
*Goal: Deepen the educational value by linking reconnaissance actions and findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, helping users understand the broader context of their techniques.*

*   [ ] **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping in Tool Wrappers/Parsers:**
    *   [ ] Research and identify relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with the information gathered by Nmap, Gobuster, Nikto, and enum4linux-ng.
    *   [ ] Modify the `parse_output` methods in tool classes (or add a subsequent analysis step) to include a list of relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs in their structured results.
*   [ ] **AI Explanation of MITRE Techniques:**
    *   [ ] Update the `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to instruct the AI to:
        *   Recognize MITRE technique IDs in tool results.
        *   Briefly explain the identified technique(s) to the user in simple terms when discussing tool findings.
        *   (Optional) Provide a link to the MITRE ATT&CK website for that technique.
*   [ ] **`debrief` Generator Update:**
    *   [ ] Include a section in the Markdown report listing the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified/used during the session.
*   [ ] **(Stretch Goal for 4.5) Simple `--show-mitre-matrix` for Session:**
    *   [ ] At the end of a session, provide an option to display a very simple, text-based summary of tactics covered (e.g., Reconnaissance: [T1046, T1083], Discovery: [T1087]). Not a full visual matrix yet, but a list.

**Status: Phase 4.5 - To Be Started**

---

**Post v1.0 (After Nailing Phase 4.5 & Gathering Feedback):**

*   **User Feedback Analysis:** Collect and analyze user feedback on the v1.0 experience. What do they love? What's missing? What's confusing?
*   **Next Steps Prioritization:** Based on feedback and your vision, then decide on features from the original "Phase 5+" (e.g., more advanced progressive disclosure, hint systems, specific skill modules, plugin architecture if heavily requested) or entirely new ideas.
*   **Focus on iterative improvements** to the core experience.

**AI Assistant Reference & Project Vision**

**What is Alien Recon (a37)?**
- An AI-guided, modular recon framework for CTFs, red team drills, and OSINT.
- Designed for beginners and pros: automates tedious recon, but also teaches and explains.
- CLI-driven, with AI chat guidance and structured, actionable output.

**Current Capabilities:**
- Robust wrappers for nmap, gobuster, nikto, enum4linux-ng, hydra, and http-fetcher.
- All tools have real parsing logic and are fully tested (including edge/error cases).
- Consistent output schema (`ToolResult`) for all tools.
- Interactive and scriptable CLI (Typer-based).
- System health/doctor checks.

**Your Vision & Goals:**
- Make CTF recon accessible, fast, and educational.
- Blend automation with AI mentorship: teach users the "why" and "how" of recon, not just the "what".
- Enable both guided (novice) and power-user (expert/auto) workflows.
- Build a foundation for extensibility: new tools, new task types, new learning modules.

**What You're Working Towards:**
- Phase 3: Orchestrated, rule-based auto-recon (TaskQueue, TaskDetail, auto mode).
- Phase 4: "Zero-to-First-Blood"â€”a newcomer can get a flag with AI help, and generate a debrief report.
- Phase 4.5: MITRE ATT&CK tagging and educational context.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
- **Move into Phase 3 now:** Your core is strong and tested. Build the orchestration layer (TaskQueue, auto mode) with your current tools. This will validate your architecture and make it easy to add new tools later.
- **Design for extensibility:** Make TaskQueue/TaskDetail generic and pluggable. Each new tool should be a new task type, easy to add/test.
- **After auto-recon works, add more tools:** ffuf, wpscan, amass, searchsploit, etc. can be added as new tasks.
- **Focus on user experience:** Keep the AI guidance clear, actionable, and educational. Make the CLI and reports beautiful and motivating.
- **Gather feedback early:** Once auto-recon is working, get user feedback to guide Phase 4/4.5 priorities.

**Things You Could Add (Future):**
- More tool integrations (ffuf, wpscan, amass, nuclei, etc.)
- Plugin/task registration system for community-contributed modules
- More advanced reporting (Markdown, HTML, PDF)
- Interactive learning/hint modules
- Pro mode with advanced chaining, custom task graphs
- Cloud/remote target support
- Web UI or TUI (text UI) for richer experience

**If you're an AI or developer jumping in:**
- Read the README and this section for project philosophy and priorities.
- Review the CLI, SessionController, and tool wrappers for architecture.
- All new tools should follow the `ToolResult` schema and have robust tests/fixtures.
- Focus on making recon both powerful and educationalâ€”automation is great, but teaching is the differentiator.
